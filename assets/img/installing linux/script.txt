>First step format flashdrive as fat32 and boot the linux ISO and copy files to th flashdrive so its bootable on a PC

>Next choose PC.
>Two options Intel G3 with 32GB of DDR4 a 6500 and no GPU, limited to two drives as its a non modular PSU also no upgradability as it propriotary hardware.
>second option is my old gaming PC 4790k 16gb of ddr3 modular PSU gtx 970. 
>cant swap components as the g3 is 1151 socket and old gaming pc is 1150
>choosing g3 for now
>will buy 1151 motherboard for old gaming pc and swap components later



>configure DHCP range to give first IP addresses static IP


>install two drive 
>will use RAID 1 until upgrade as mirroring
>plug and usb and boot from usb
>install ubuntu and go through setup
>use Static IP during setup
>configure RAID 1
>continue setup
>user password, etc
>reboot to finish install
>login
>server is now operational
>sudo apt update


>setup static ip for server once it shows on network
>use MAC from ARP table 
>set static IP using MAC and set IP

>setup SSH cause i dont feel like walking over to the server

>install Docker
>install Docker compose plugin as immich requires it
>install Immich

>install Immich on android
>login using server IP and port
>must be connected to wifi
>verify working


>setup DDNS through cloudflare
(theres a dynamic DNS setting in my router but I chose cloudflare for future proofing)
>create API token with zone permissions
>this will update the IP through cloudflare when it detects a change
>create A record for existing domain
>creater docker file
>favonia/cloudflare-ddnss is the github distro
>deploy and verify working
>will check every 5 minutes so possibility of 5 minute down time
>can check with docker logs
>set IP wrong in cloudflare a record (eg. 8.8.8.8)
>on initial docker startup it should correct the IP to your public IP


>install OpenVPN on server
>verify running
>first time login with user "openvpn" and temp password created in log
>route IP to newly created a record for the domain
>forward UDP port 1194 in router to server
>create new admin user
>enable MFA
>delete old Admin
>in group policy settings
>make sure subnet is the same as the docker subnet in ubuntu
>otherwise you will not be able to route to immich docker IP
>head to user UI instead of admin
>download OVPN file
>plug in android and transfer to phone THIS IS A KEY DO NOT PUT IN PUBLIC
>import on openvpn app
>delete OVPN file after profile set up

>this setup is a good proof of concept but not secure
>setup rootless docker
